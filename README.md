End-to-End Data Integration and Visualization with Snowflake and Tableau

Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive end-to-end data pipeline and visualization process, showcasing data engineering, transformation, and analytics. Using Snowflake for data processing and Tableau for visualization, the project highlights the seamless integration of modern data tools to deliver insightful dashboards.
Project Objectives
1. Data Integration and Transformation 
â€¢	Import raw datasets into a staging schema in Snowflake.  
â€¢	Clean, transform, and prepare data for analysis.  
â€¢	Move processed data into a production schema for reporting.  
2. Visualization and Insights 
â€¢	Connect Snowflake's production schema to Tableau for data visualization.  
â€¢	Develop interactive dashboards to provide actionable insights.  
â€¢	Publish dashboards on Tableau Public for wider accessibility.  
Process and Execution
1. Data Engineering
â€¢	Staging Schema Setup: Created a staging schema in Snowflake with 3-dimension tables and 1 fact table for raw data processing.  
â€¢	Data Transformation: Cleaned and formatted the data to resolve missing values, inconsistencies, and type mismatches.  
â€¢	Production Schema: Transferred transformed data into the production schema for final analysis and visualization.

2. Visualization Development
Connection to Tableau: Configured Tableau Desktop to connect directly to the Snowflake production schema.  
â€¢	Interactive Dashboards: Designed a dynamic dashboard with:  
o	7 visualizations (bar charts, line graphs, and maps).  
o	1 parameter for user-driven filtering.  
o	2 interactive actions to enhance exploration.  
o	Efficient container usage for layout optimization.  
o	Publishing: Deployed the dashboards on Tableau Public for sharing and collaboration.
Challenges Faced
1. Data Cleaning: Addressed issues like missing values and type mismatches during transformation.  
2. Connection Issues: Overcame challenges in maintaining stable connectivity between Snowflake and Tableau.  
3. Performance Optimization: Tuned Snowflake queries and optimized Tableau dashboards to ensure seamless performance.
 Lessons Learned
1. Data Processing: The importance of a robust staging schema for reliable data transformation and analysis.  
2. Tool Integration: Efficiently configuring and managing connections between Snowflake and Tableau is critical.  
3. Dashboard Design: Creating user-friendly, dynamic dashboards with actionable insights greatly enhances stakeholder experience.


 Future Improvements
â€¢	Automating data transformation processes to reduce manual intervention.  
â€¢	Leveraging advanced Tableau features like storylines for enhanced storytelling.  
â€¢	Implementing error-handling mechanisms for seamless Snowflake-Tableau synchronization.  
â€¢	Extending the project to a cloud-native environment, such as Azure, for scalability and additional learning.
